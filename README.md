# Functions to register app users
<img src="./images/register_app.jpg">

- The objective of this project is to develop a new account registration system for a mobile app. The system must validate user input on the sign-up form before creating an account.

- Functions have been created to validate the name, email, and password. These functions are used to register users, store their data, and implement error handling.

- Make sure to inspect the docstrings of each helper function: **validate_name**, **validate_email**, and **validate_password**. These functions need to be imported into the workspace.
